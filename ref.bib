abstract = {We present a study of the dynamics of traversing an avoided energy level crossing. A pair of Stark levels of Rydberg states of lithium are used. as a, test system for measuring the diabatic transition probability. The experimental conditions are close to those assumed by the Landau-Zener theory. Possible corrections to the Landau- Zener theory are analyzed, and applications of the results to pulsed-field ionization are discussed.},

If the electron neutrino is produced far above the resonance density, this probability is simply given by "e Analytic results are presented for the probability of detecting an electron neutrino after passage (P„)=sin Hp+ P„cos28p, where Hp is the vacuum mix- ing angle. The probability is averaged over the production as well as the detection positions of the neutrino and P„ is the Landau-Zener transition probability between adiabatic states. Finally, this result is applied to resonance oscillations within the solar interior.},
