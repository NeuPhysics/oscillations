Notes - 2015 Summer
=====================

~~**I'll be travelling in the following week and have no access to internet. So I'll just read the book and the papers.**~~

2015-06-09: I am back and will work tomorrow.

Here are the notes for my summer work.

## Vacuum Oscillations

1. **Equation of motion** for vacuum oscillations;
2. **Survival probability** if pure electron flavor was produced;
3. **Solve numerically the EoM** and compare.


## Solar Neutrino Oscillations

1. **EoM** in dense matter;
2. **Survival probability** as a function of energy *E*;
3. **Numerical method** to solve the EoM.
